# Security Policy

Thank you for helping make Traffic Torch safer! We take security seriously and appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing any vulnerabilities you discover.

## Supported Versions

Traffic Torch is a static site hosted on GitHub Pages with ongoing development on the main branch. Security updates (if needed) are applied to:

- The current live version (main branch deployment)

We aim to address critical issues promptly across the active deployment.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **do not** report security issues via public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.

Instead, report vulnerabilities privately by emailing:

**traffictorch@gmail.com**

Include as much detail as possible to help us understand and reproduce the issue:

- A clear description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce (including any URLs or inputs used)
- Potential impact
- Your name/handle (optional, for proper credit if desired)

We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours and strive to provide regular updates on progress.

If the report is valid, we will work to fix it quickly, coordinate disclosure if needed, and credit you in release notes (unless you prefer anonymity).

We follow responsible disclosure practices and appreciate your patience during investigation and remediation.

Thank you again for contributing to the security of Traffic Torch!
