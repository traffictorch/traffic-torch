    how: "Readability is tested using Flesch Reading Ease and Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level scores, average sentence length, paragraph density, and scannability elements like bolding, lists, and subheadings. Each factor is scored individually and combined into an overall module grade.",
    why: "Easy-to-read content reaches a wider audience, improves engagement metrics, and reduces cognitive strain. Search engines reward pages where users stay longer and interact more. Great readability is essential for modern web success."
